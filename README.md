**Gaussian_Mixture_Model**

The Gaussian mixture model will be assuming all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.

In this project we will be importing euclidean_distance, normalize, plot from mlfromscratch.utils

We will create a class and will define functions such as init, multivariate gaussian and some other functions.
After defining functions, updating weights will be done.

With these defined functions we can organize data by identifying commonalities and distinguishing them from one another. 
We can also use it  classify consumers into subgroups defined by factors like demographics etc.
